# 🏆 Personal Tracker: Discipline XP System

**Personal Tracker** is a high-performance React application designed to gamify habit formation. Unlike traditional trackers, this system uses a **League Ranking System** (inspired by Clash of Clans) where your consistency earns you "Discipline XP," allowing you to climb from Bronze to Legend status.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ⚔️ The League System
Your progress is tracked via **Discipline XP**. As you reach point thresholds, your rank and badge automatically upgrade:
* **Bronze / Silver / Gold:** The foundation of discipline.
* **Crystal / Master / Champion:** Advanced consistency.
* **Legend:** Elite level habit mastery (20,000+ XP).

### 📈 Smart Multi-Line Analytics
* **Categorized Tracking:** Group habits into "Health," "Work," or "Personal."
* **Adaptive Graphs:** Real-time Recharts integration that bridges gaps for non-daily habits (2x/3x week) using `connectNulls` logic.
* **Visual History:** Watch your streaks climb across different frequencies in a single unified view.

### ⚖️ Discipline Modes
* **Strict Mode:** High stakes. Missing a window results in a **1.5x penalty** based on your current streak.
* **Flexible Mode:** Life-friendly. A minor **0.5x penalty** for missed days.
* **Frequency Support:** Built-in logic for Daily, 3x Week, 2x Week, Weekly, and Monthly rhythms.

### 🌑 Premium UI/UX
* **Glassmorphism Design:** Modern, blurred background cards with sleek borders.
